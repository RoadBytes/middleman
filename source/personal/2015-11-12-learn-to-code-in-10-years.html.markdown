### Show Notes:

Today, I came across a funny article and I thought I've have a bit of a reading time...

It basically has to do with all these tutorials that teach you code in 21 Days:

Learn C# in 21 days
Learn Ruby in 21 days

I'm reading an article I found online from Abstruse Goose Called "How to Teach Yourself Programming"

The article can be found here:

Seriously though.  Why is everyone in such a hurry?

### Here are my top 10 things to do, to enjoy the coding journey:

#### 10. give yourself 30 minutes everyday to code with out interruption

#### 9.  go to a meetup group

#### 8.  find an open source project you would like to help out with

#### 7.  blog about what you're doing

#### 6.  make YouTube videos about self studying

#### 5.  email me about a video you'd like to see about coding and see if I make it

#### 4.  give me money... just thought I'd give it a shot

#### 3.  apply to jobs coding and see what happens

#### 2.  find a mentor and ask them to review your code

#### 1.  find a mentee and show them what you know

So, that is it for this weeks episode.
