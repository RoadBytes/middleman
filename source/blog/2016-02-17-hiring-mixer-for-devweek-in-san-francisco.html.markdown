Just Finished with the DevWeek Hiring Mixer

Man it was AWESOME!  I was really apprehensive at first because I don't have much confidence in my skill at the moment, but going there has smashed all my apprehension and I'm more excited to get shit done!!!  The people I talked to weren't judgmental and they gave some great advice for new coders.

* Open Gov dude
  * Get out there and contribute to various code bases.  Show you know a technology and then you'll find opportunities as your code is used and propigated.  

* Circle CI
  * Find a supportive mentoring community OVER more income.  Learning and finding networks will be more valuable in the long run and create more opportunities in the future.

* The Information
  * This was a really cool company fully supported by user subscription fees.  They are basically a independent media company providing inside information and new to niche groups.
  * The guy here was super nice and friendly.  He said he was from a bootcamp himself and is now an engineer with the company.  He does work on the website, but also contributes to the news and data visualization end.
  * I was trying to jack myself a moleskin but got too shy.  Haha.

* Random Data Visualization Guy
  * there was a guy there that just randomly approached us and talked about working remotely with his company.  He did data analysis for marketers and was looking for people versed in data science.  
  * He was saying that getting experience in this would guarantee employment in the future as this skill set is becoming more and more sought after.

* Shtuff I'm thinking about learning
  * D3 data visualization
  * Data Science
