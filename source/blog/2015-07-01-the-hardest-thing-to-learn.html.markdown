Man, the hardest thing for me to learn is being consistent.  For some reason I set a goal for myself, and then when the time comes to actually put in work, I on to another thing.  I feel like a three year old wanting to play Nintendo despite having no idea how to play.

But, yeah, I'm working on it.  Some cool resources:

* *Practicing Mind* by Some Dude
* *Soft Skills* by Sonmez
* *simpleprogrammer.com*
* *Practicing Consistency* by Weldon Long

## What I'm learning

### Point 1

Insert a bunch of crap about point one. Insert a bunch of crap about point one. Insert a bunch of crap about point one. Insert a bunch of crap about point one. Insert a bunch of crap about point one.

### Point 2

*Some Quote*

> Getting the self discipline to be effective in coding and learning will come one day.

Insert a bunch of crap about point one. Insert a bunch of crap about point one. Insert a bunch of crap about point one. Insert a bunch of crap about point one. Insert a bunch of crap about point one.

## In Conclusion

Insert a bunch of crap about point one. Insert a bunch of crap about point one. Insert a bunch of crap about point one. Insert a bunch of crap about point one. Insert a bunch of crap about point one.
