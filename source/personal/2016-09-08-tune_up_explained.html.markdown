I'm learning a lot about Object Oriented Programming (OOP) design, and these
**Tune Ups** are meant to share my discoveries with other self directed learners
out there in the internets.

There are a lot of materials for new coders, and a good amount for experts, but
not much for people in between, so I'm hoping these challenges help bridge the
gap between newbies and experts.

The diagram was stollen from a [great article](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard) describing why getting proficient is so challenging.

So, this is  the context I have when putting together **RoadBytes TuneUps**.
I'm learning Ruby programming and aiming to become a Full Stack web developer so
these challenges are aimed at others going in the same direction.

# My Stack

* Ruby version 2.x
* Git/GitHub
* RuboCop for clean code and kosherness

## potential future challenges will include

* html/css/js
* sass
* some front end frameworks like: React, D3
* I'm open to requests

## optional

You'll see me using these technologies, but you don't need to yourself

* terminal
* vim
* tmux

# Scope of the Challenges

I'm assuming you know about OOP, but need more exposure to become proficient in
applying these principles to real world problems.

With these challenges, you'll be asked to:

1. read through specifications to get an idea of what the task is
2. fork a repo provided in the prompt
3. implement the changes to the code base
4. push your work onto a remote repo
5. compare with other coders solutions

# What if I'm a beginner?

If you need help on learning how to work with TuneUps, feel free to send me an
email (jason.data@roadbytes.me), and I can add instructional videos and meet up
in person to make these challenges more accessible.  Trust me, getting started
can be very frustrating but with persistence and patience, you'll get into these
TuneUp challenges in no time.
