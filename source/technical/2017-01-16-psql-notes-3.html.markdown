## Anomalies

ex: phone calls to certain numbers

* update: changing info means changing many rows
* insertion: you must have a row, to have number info
* deletion: removing all calls to a number removes the number's info

## Great article on double vs single quotes in PSQL

# Extracting an 1:M Relationship

When extracting data:

1. Create a table for new relation
2. Insert data
3. Create relationship
4. Update films table to reference new relation
5. Clean up
  * set relation 'table name'\_id to `NOT NULL`
  * remove redundant data from original table: drop columns
  * move constraints to new table
