#### tl:dr
note on *Power of Consistency* by Long

Man, I just listened to the audiobook of *The Power of Consistency* by Weldon Long and I'm going to try out some of what he says.  For some people, I'm sure it can be a little fru-fru, but I think it eventually hits some good points where he talks about getting an idea of where you want to go to and setting yourself up with some directions to this goals with a few simple directions through habits/actions to get you there.

Oh, my gosh I'm so freaking tired and I can't really read or write straight right now.  Gah!!

Ok, I'm done for now
