## Let's start with the Humble points

"Napkins" served in tissue boxes.  Furniture decor consists of outdoor IKEA deckwares.  Tucked in the corner it's almost invisible next to a neighborhood church and small grocery milk bar.  But, despite all it's colloquial fixtures, this place kicks ass.

## Strong Points

Mister Truongs is clearly a local favorite scoring well above the other nearby restaurants.  It's the only restaurant in the 4's range while other local spots have trouble breaking 3.5.

The roast pork is the best I've ever had in my entire life.  His sandwiches have amazing ingredients including fresh veggies, chili peppers (optional), warm toasted rolls, savoury seasoned spread, and either chicken, beef, or roast pork.

His [menu](https://www.zomato.com/melbourne/mister-truongs-brunswick-west/menu#tabtop) is affordable and tasty, my two favorite things.  Affordable and tasty reminds me of what I ACTUALLY give a shit about.  if you ever get a chance to grace Melbourne with your presence and you happen to be in Brunswick West, definitely stop by this spot.

#### Putting Mister Truongs down my pie hole makes me feel like a human again.
