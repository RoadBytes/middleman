* How to learn quickly

# Set specifically what you want to do
* Get specific to minimize the goal at hand
* ie, I want to code a calculator program
* ie, I want to order food at a French restaurant totally in French
* Application: For Lindsey, I want her to
    * ( code a blog program/ finish Ruby the Hard Way )

# Deconstruct the skill
* Break down the complex skills to smaller subskills

# Learn just enough to implement the deconstruction
* Find the resources to get the information/feedback you need to gain proficiencty
* Be mindful of different cognitive acts
  * Specifically, semantic vs motor skills

# Practice at least 20 hours
* This is about getting enough time to get past frustration point
* Have a fixed number of 20 minute sessions
* Work in smaller chunks at strategic times
  * ie, touch type before bed for 30 mins and compare performance when you wake up
* Simulated practice
  * get it as close to "real world" activity as possibility
* Deep Work
  * minimize the energy to get to work
  * Alter your environment to be conducive of deep work
    * quiet
    * accessible
    * free from distraction
