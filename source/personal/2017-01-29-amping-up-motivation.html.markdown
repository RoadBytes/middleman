I was stressed out applying for jobs.  The job was an External. I found peace in
focusing on the process

It's not just about Tech skills

Soft skills are important too
  * companies that don't focus on soft skills may not be a great place to work
    at

I got a job! We are talking about soft skills all through out the interview.

I'm looking at Thoughbot's apprenticeship program
[https://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-to-set-up-your-companys-apprenticeship](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-to-set-up-your-companys-apprenticeship)
and the start of the material is mostly on soft skills.  This was interesting
because so many interviews focus on technical proficiency, and I always thought
something was missing from tech focused grilling of the applicants.

Thoughbot recommends [*Search Inside
Yourself*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12921211-search-inside-yourself),
and/or [*Apprenticeship
Paterns*](https://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382)
for apprentices and mentors to read before the start of the program.

Applying for jobs was and is very frustrating, but I've learned to focus on
intrinsic motivations.

Pink did a study on *Creative Work* and found that in order to perform more
creatively autonomy, mastery, and purpose where more positively correlated and
money incentives actually *inhibited* performance at some point.
