I've the opportunity to be in Silicon Valley for the months of August and September, and along with spending time with family, I'm going to meet up groups and meeting a lot of people in the tech community.  One meetup group that I found interesting is the Lean Circle which consist of people practicing *lean principles* to improve on a business model or product.

I only got about half way through *Lean Startup* book by Eric Ries and after that the material felt a little dense, but going to an event centered around Lean Principles made the ideas more tangible.  The logistics of the night involved people leading sessions based on questions about products that they are working on, or thinking about.  You can basically see what people are discussing on this big white board and you pick which of the sessions you want to check out.

# Take home principle that I really found interesting was to take nothing for granted and test all things with **Data**.

*Do you think people will pay for music?*

* Who is buying what?

Ultimately, I'm learning how important it is to pay attention and evaluate assumptions we have about the world around us.  An informed man or woman and truly make a lasting improvement to those he/she does business with.
