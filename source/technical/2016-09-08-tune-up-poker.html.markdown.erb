Hello World!  This is the first of hopefully many coding challenges with
RoadBytes.  A general description of tunes ups can be found here:

[RoadBytes:TuneUps Explained](http://roadbytes.me/personal/2016/09/08/tune_up_explained.html)

If you understand how to work with TuneUps,
[here is a link to the repo for this challenge](https://github.com/RoadBytes/TuneUpPoker/tree/tune_up_poker_start)

In [Launch School](https://launchschool.com), I was given a challenge to create
a poker hand application that would take in a series of poker hands and return
the highest hands.

# Specs

## Input

Hands would be in the form of an array with two character strings. ie.

~~~ ruby

high_of_jack  = %w(4S 5S 7H 8D JC)
high_of_queen = %w(2S 4H 6S TD QH)
~~~

There will just be one argument consisting of an array of hands.

~~~ ruby

Poker.new([high_of_8, high_of_queen])
~~~

## Output

* Simply consists of an array with the highest hands from the input.  There can be
ties.
  * See more details on Poker rules on
[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hand_categories)

~~~

[high_of_queen]
~~~

* See the `test.rb` file from the repo for more information.
  * <%= link_to 'https://github.com/RoadBytes/TuneUpPoker/blob/tune_up_poker_start/test.rb',
      'https://github.com/RoadBytes/TuneUpPoker/blob/tune_up_poker_start/test.rb' %>

# Challenge

If you look at the `poker.rb` file, when I implemented this challenge, I made a
method `Poker#best_hand` that didn't really fit in the Poker class.

~~~ ruby

def best_hand
  best_hands = best_ranked_hands
  highest_card_value = 0
  best_hands.each do |hand|
    high_hand_value = hand.max_card_value
    if high_hand_value > highest_card_value
      highest_card_value = high_hand_value
    end
  end
  best_hands.select { |hand| hand.max_card_value == highest_card_value }
            .map(&:input)
end
~~~

<% q_one = "Take a look at the Poker#best_hand method above and think of some reasons why it might be too complex" %>
<% a_one = simple_format "Just my opinion\n\n * Poker should deal with `Hand` and not necessarily `Hand#max_card_value`\n * There are levels of indentation that may be avoided\n * Working a collection of `Hand`s may be best dealt with in the `Hand` class\n\n What do you think?  Did you come up with other ways of thinking?\n" %>
<%= question_toggle(q_one, a_one) %>

# Your mission, should you choose to accept it,

* refactor `Poker#best_hand` in a way that would be more sensible.

* Remember, **RoadBytes TuneUps** are code challenges that are meant to promote
  1. Working with git
  2. Code Literacy
  3. Refactoring
  4. Collaborating
