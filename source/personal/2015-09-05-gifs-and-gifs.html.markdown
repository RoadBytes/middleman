![my first gif of basically random crap on my desktop](images/first.gif)

This is my first gif ever and I'm really excited about how easy it is.

I was on codenewbie's slack and found a really cool [desktop window to gif app](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) through @nadiab.

I was actually [looking at her post on Git/GitHub](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s287/sh/1ae96146-5500-49be-9ba2-81083dc77251/8c2fe360395446b8) and saw how easy it was to follow with the gif videos.

### Here are some things I like about using gifs:

* it's basically treated similar to an image file.
* it has dynamic movement with out much work.
* it's great for code snippets and tutoring.

### Some things to consider:

* keep in mind the size of the file, higher frame rates mean larger files.
* it may be a hefty download time if there are many gifs on a page.
* I'm not too sure about browser support.

I'm looking forward to adding these gifs in tutorials and stuff.
